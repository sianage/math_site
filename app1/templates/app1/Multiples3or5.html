<h1>Multiples of 3 or 5</h1>
<br><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 50px" style="color:white;" align="left">
        <h2 style="color:white;">
            Problem: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
            The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

            <br><br>

            This is a very simple problem. You loop through all values from 1 to 1000 and check if
            each number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. If not, you check if it has a
            remainder of 0 when divided by 5. If no operation has a result of 0, you move onto
            the next number. If one of the operations does have a remainder of 0, you add that number
            to the total.
